WEEK 01:

Group formation and brainstorming potential project ideas.

WEEK 02:

For project selection, we created a decision matrix to choose the 
best project for our team under a certain criteria. I suggested
project 6 (Stock Porfolio Management) due to my experience in
stock trading and investing and my background in signal processing,
which I hope to use in providing analytics to the project.

WEEK 03:

I focused on researching the current market of portfolio
management systems to figure out what ours will offer and how it 
differs from others. I came to the conclusion that generally all 
portfolio management systems have a set of core functionality 
that we must also provide but is missing any feature to aid the 
investor in building their own portfolio.

WEEK 04:

Submission of project proposal and clarification of the technology 
stack. We decided to use a React in the front end and the Alphavantage 
API.

WEEK 05:

I spent most of my time figuring out how to create a useable class 
that provides information on a stock. This turned out to be not 
possible in React as it can not treat the components as a regular 
class. I was able to produce something that correctly called the API 
but face difficulty in formatting it in a reusable manner.

WEEK 06:

I mostly focused on setting up the UI elements on the webapp.
I refactored the component code such that they are more consistent 
and started integrating bootstrap into UI elements. I changed the API 
stock class to be callable from other components and automatically display 
in a table format.  

WEEK 07:

I set up each page according to our UI discussion on Monday. I created a 
table drop down for user watchlists and created the Portfolio page with the 
overview and table component.
