Week 1:
    In week 1 we formed the start of a group, including Nic and Alvin and 2 others
    I had to email Lecture as to why no demonstrator was present and to ask that
    the possible projects could be posted on webcms as without them we could not begin work
    But still we started Brainstorming anyway and produced the following ideas:
    Natural language processing -> control file system
        •	Delete, move copy ect
    metadata consolidation website
        •	Like webjet
    Job hunting helper
        •	Looks for changes in company websites for job openings
        •	Sends notification
    Natural language processing the handbook for requires

Week 2:
    We had to cut the initial group of 5 to be a group of 3 so the other 2 could form a group of 4
    I lead the team to complete an MCDA (Multi Criteria Decision Analysis) to
    decide which project to do
    We decided on project 6 - Stock Website
    Each of us then started investigating defeat sites and API's
    I looked in Yahoo Finance
    We also Brainstormed additional features
    Possible extension
        •	Addition of bitcoin/gold tracking
        •	Night mode
        •	Leaderboard
        •	Risk
        •	Diversity graph/calculation

    But we can't do much on the proposal as the groups-project matches havn't been confirmed

Week 3:
    Was sick for the Lab on Monday but we're finally confirmed to be working on
    the stock website project.
    So we Discussed who is doing what for the proposal, I was going to be covering
    the Illustrations, Infrastructure and Team Roles

    On Friday we had a split group meeting on Friday to refine what we were doing in the proposal

    Saturday Night I completed a MCDA for system architecture systems settling on
    a standard Client Server architecture and added it and my other bits to the proposal

Week 4:
    This week we focused on submitting the proposal with each other reading and editing the work
    Afterwards we settled on using React for the front end and Alphavantage as the
    API to call

Week 5:
    As the others were wroking on calling the API I focused on setting up the base
    Website. This involved following and combining multiple online tutorials as well
    as learing Javascript and React at the same time. After some work I pushed
    understood the basics of such react one-page websites and pushed a working
    Scafold to git for the others to add to

Week 6:
    As Alvin couldn't get the stock component to display its information, I spent
    most of my time of the project trying to get it to work.
    I still do not know exactly what the problem was but it seemed as though even
    though the stock.render() method was called. The element was not mounted and threw
    and error when this.setState() was run.
    I tried updating all dependencies in case there was an error as well as
    attempting to forcing the element to be mounted in different ways.

    In the end Nic figured out a way around it by re writing the Alvins work using
    a different module.

Week 7:
